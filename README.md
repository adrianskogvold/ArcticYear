# ArcticYear


Yea we dont know what we are doing either


## Todos
- [] Decide how to transition between seasons (user initiated?)
- [] Split up mountains into individual elements we can parallax
- [] Add in introduction (A Year in Tromso, click here to continue)
- [] Add in sounds for winter (maybe binaural?)
- [] Add in a way to move between seasons
- [] Change snow to CSS to use hardware? (http://pajasevi.github.io/CSSnowflakes/)\
- [] Northern lights
- [] Can we make clouds use the web animation API?

## Idea Log
- What if we made it informative about Tromso? So, this is Tromsdalstinden, this is how high it is, here is how much the record snowfall it got? Then we could use red outlines to indicate the area.
- Should we constrain the aspect ratio so it looks semi-okay on most screens?
